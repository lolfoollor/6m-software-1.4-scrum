## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. In your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Scrum helps to break down large IT projects to smaller and more managable chunks. This ensures faster deliverables which helps the school to see if they need any changes or feedbacks. Moreover, this helps to keep everyone informed.

Scrum also can help sort out and prioritize the important product backlog and toss it into the spring backlog. This way all the essential and important features can be implemented first. At the end of every sprint cycle, sprint retrospectives encourage the team to reflect on what worked well and what can be improved, leading to continuous learning and better efficiency in future sprints.
```

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
As a user's parent, I want to have the option to restrict what my child can view so that my child will not be able to view these books.

As a user, I want to have the options to adjust the font (size, color and text-to-speech option), so that I can read any information in the bulletin with ease.

As a user, I want to have a website that loads in less than 3s so that I can use the website efficiently.

As an advertiser, I want to be able to put my advertisement into the website, so that many users can look at the advertistment and I can earn money. 

As a library staff, I want to be able to see all activities, so that I can collate data on what books to stock up and chase overdue books and manage library easier. 

As a library staff, I want to be able to create catalogs/tags of book easily so that I can catagorize it to make users and make the average search time lower. (Horror, Action, Adventure)

As a user, I want to be able to have a loan interface, so that I can extend or end the loan prematurely or look at the loan deadline.

As a user, I want to be able to log in to the website so that I can save all my preference or potentially send a notification when the book becomes available.

As a user, I want to be able to see the availablity of a book so that when I head down to library, it is there.

As a user, I want to be able search book by title, author, genre so that I can easily find the book and it's location.
